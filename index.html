        <h2 class="center">Our Mission</h2>
        <p class="center"> Rad Mutual Education is a mutual-aid driven organization making science, technology, engineering and mathematics 
            (STEM) education accessible to everyone within our community through skillshare, mentoring, and technology access. We believe in 
            structuring educational plans around consensus building between students, instructors and their communities that account for 
            students’ holistic needs such as emotional, financial and environmental support.

            <h2 class="about-header">Who We Are</h3>
            <p class="about-paragraph"> Rad Mutual Education is an organization committed to bringing STEM (science, technology, 
                engineering, & mathematics) education to our communities through organized skillshare and in collaboration with mutual aid 
                organizations. Individually, we are computer science students at Western Washington University who wish to see our communities 
                thrive, and believe that providing STEM education for the youth is one of the most effective ways of doing that.</p>

            <h2 class="about-header">What We Provide</h3>
            <p class="about-paragraph"> We provide students within and in association with our communities with free STEM education. 
                At this time, we are only offering free regular computer science and programming lessons for students ages ten and up via 
                Zoom. Your student does <b>not</b> need to know computer science, programming, or math. Each unit we teach will introduce 
                a wide range of important computer science topics and skills.
            </p>
            <p class="about-paragraph"> If you do not have computer or internet access, we will help coordinate with local resources, 
                such as schools, libraries, and community members, to provide suitable technologies. We will provide free snacks, books, 
                and paper activity drop-offs to ensure that we are clearing as many obstacles as possible for kids who would like to learn 
                with us.
            </p>

            <h2 class="about-header">Why It's Useful</h3>
            <p class="about-paragraph"> Exposure to various fields is beneficial to personal growth and understanding - no matter what 
                your student hopes to study someday, learning about computer science is expanding their knowledge of what’s out there.
            </p>

            <h2 class="about-header">Where Community Matters</h3>
            <p class="about-paragraph"> We will continue to grow RME to meet the needs of our community, with immediate efforts to 
                eliminate traditional barriers to learning by collaborating with mutual aid groups. We encourage you to connect with us 
                and share thoughts on how to best support the educational needs of our community as this change occurs.
